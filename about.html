    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing my Computer Programming diploma at Humber College while working part-time at WIS International. This balance has taught me valuable skills in time management, problem-solving under pressure, and effective communication in professional settings.</p>
    
    <p>My technical journey includes mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and exploring backend technologies. I'm particularly passionate about cybersecurity and aim to contribute to open-source security tools. Beyond coding, I enjoy studying ethical hacking techniques and understanding how to build more secure applications.</p>
    
    <p>One of my core principles is that great developers never stop learning. I dedicate time each week to explore new technologies, experiment with different frameworks, and participate in coding challenges to sharpen my skills.</p>
